## What is software complexity?

## What causes it?

---

## Complexity

Code- and system-level factors that make a system hard to *modify* and *understand*.

- Complexity relates to *human capabilities in a system*.

---

## Causes of Complexity

**State** presents a key complexity:

- a set of $D$ data-structures,
- a set of $A$ assumptions on those data-structures, and
- a set of $O$ operations on them.

New features means adding more **state** $D'$, assumptions $A'$, and operations $O'$.
- $\forall o \in O'$ must be consistent with $D$ and $A$,
- $\forall a \in A'$ must be consistent with $A$ and $O$.
- For each operation *interleaving* ($O_n \times O_n, O_n = O \cup O'$)

---

## Causes of Complexity

As systems grow, so do $D$, $A$, and $O$.

- It is very difficult to maintain consistency.
- For each operation, you must consider *all* operations, data-structures, & assumptions
  - quadratic complexity!
- When learning a code-base: what are the assumptions?
  - most assumptions are *unstated and implicit*

---

## Causes of Complexity

Additional perspectives on these causes:

- *Dependencies* - Logical connections between different code.
  - Dependencies from: state & relationships between modules.
  - *Local* changes have *non-local impacts*.
  - Hard to maintain consistency of assumptions.
- *Obscurity* - When important information is hard to understand.
  - How difficult is it to understand the system's assumptions?
  - ...and to maintain them with updates?

---

## Environmental Complexity

The *functional behavior* in the specification is often not the full story.

Other requirements:
- Performance
- Parallelism
- Security
- Reliability

---

## Case Study: kv-cache

**Specification**:
- Operations:
  - `get(k) -> v` return the value associated with the key
  - `set(k, v) -> bool` update or add a value associated with the key

---

## Impl 1:  Simplicity

- Data-structures:
  - open-addressed, statically allocated, hash-table, with kvs inlined
- Assumptions:
  - fixed size keys & values
  - static allocation of hash-table and kv slots
  - single concurrent operation at a time
  - LRU tracked using kv access times

---

## Impl 2: Fast

- Data-structures:
  - separate-chained, concurrent hash-table, with lock-protected, partitioned LRU lists
- Assumptions:
  - each KV associated with a HT bucket & LRU list
  - each HT bucket associated with a lock
  - each LRU list associated with a lock
  - hash to find HT and LRU lists
  - updating KV requires locking corresponding HT & LRU list (in that order)

---

## Updates to the kv-cache

Update environment:
- Security: What if we care about [hash](https://bugs.python.org/issue14621) [attacks](https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4680.en.html)?
- Parallelism & workloads:
  - mostly `get`s: avoid üîís
  - many `set`s: optimize for set ops

Update spec:
- Require operation to set cache memory size
- Enable `multiset({(k, v)}) -> bool`

**Complexities with the two implementations?**

---

## Simple implementation: update cache's memory size

Fundamental assumptions are incompatible with this!
- Statically allocated HT? ü§¶

---

```c [1-3|8|12-13]
/* Add multiset to the fast kv implementation. */
int
multiset(struct kv kvset[])
{
	int i;
	struct kv *kv;

	for (i = 0; kvset[i] != NULL; i++) {
		int err;

		kv = &kvset[i];
		err = set(kv->key, kv->val);
		if (err) return err;
	}

	return 0;
}
```

---

## Should `multiset` be atomic?

Should it set all kvs or none?

If not, then two clients calling:
- `multiset({(a, b), (c, d)})`
- `multiset({(a, e), (c, f)})`

Could result in:
- `{(a, b), (c, f)}`

Neither client asked for this!
Hard to get right in the fast version!

---

```c [7-11|14-18|10]
int
multiset(struct kv kvset[])
{
	int i;
	struct kv *kv;

	/* first take all the locks for our kvs */
	for (i = 0; kvset[i] != NULL; i++) {
		kv = &kvset[i];
		lock(&hash_table[hash(kv->key)].lock);
	}

	/* update the values, and release their locks */
	for (i = 0; kvset[i] != NULL; i++) {
		kv = &kvset[i];
		set_nolock(kv->key, kv->val);
		unlock(&hash_table[hash(kv->key)].lock);
	}

	return 0;
}
```

---

## Bug: Deadlock

Two parallel threads might take a locks in a bad order

| Step | Thread   | Take lock at... | Result |
|---|----------|-----------------|--------|
| 0 | $\tau_0$ | `hash_table[0]` | üîí |
| 1 | $\tau_1$ | `hash_table[1]` | üîí |
| 2 | $\tau_0$ | `hash_table[1]` | ‚è±Ô∏è...wait for $\tau_1$ |
| 3 | $\tau_1$ | `hash_table[0]` | ‚è±Ô∏è...wait for $\tau_0$ üí• **Deadlock** |

---

## Bug: Deadlock

Requires adding another assumption, and operation complexity
- If we must take multiple kv bucket locks, they must be taken for lower indices in the hash-table to higher-indices.

How does this interplay with assumptions around the LRU lock?

---

# Complexity Properties

---

## Is Complexity Necessary?

**Essential/Intrinsic Complexity** - The inherent complexity of a task.
This is a function of the *specification complexity*, and of the *problem to be solved*, not of implementation details.

---

## Is Complexity Necessary?

**Accidental Complexity** - Complexity that goes beyond the specification.
Often due to...

- mismatch between system abstractions and tasks,
- friction of the task with the assumptions of existing software,
- the over-generalization to solve problems beyond the task, or
- the optimization of the system.

> "...we have to keep it crisp, disentangled, and simple if we refuse to be **crushed by the complexities of our own making**...‚Äù - Dijkstra, EWD1243

## Working code *isn't enough*

Primary goal: write *well-designed* code to avoid accidental complexity

# Technical Debt

What is this?

Examples?

---

## Technical Debt

The sheer "weight" of the software.
- *Massive SW* - As SW becomes larger, the more likely it is that a new feature will cause friction with existing assumptions.
- *Unrelated assumptions* - Especially assumptions, unwieldy operations and data-structures *unrelated* to the essential complexity.
- *Edge cases* - The more assumptions we create that are unrelated to essential complexity, the more edge cases we cover, the more *technical debt* that future modifications must endure.

---

# Technical Debt

Why not just **not** create technical debt?

---

## Accidental Complexity

Mismatch between abstraction-level and specifications:

| Abstraction     | Task        | Misalignment       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| FS file/directory API | SQL per-record semantics | Abstractions mismatched   |
| Best-effort scheduler | Real-time system         | Abstractions not provided |
| Simple RTOS           | Webserver                | Abstractions inadequate   |

**Semantic gap** - distance between what is provided by the system, and what is required to accomplish a task.
- contortions within your code to approximate correct behavior $\to$ *accidental complexity*

---

# *Managing* System Complexity?

Systems with many 10s of M of SLoC seem to work. *What gives?*

---

## SLoC $\neq$ Complexity

The cognitive code is correlated with, but not a direct function of SLoC.

*Foreshadowing*: code structure matters.

---

## Choose your own Adventure

> ‚ÄúI conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to **make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies** and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. **The first method is far more difficult**.‚Äù - Hoare

---

## Simplicity

But simple isn't always possible.

- `xv6` - Simple UNIX variant (circa 1976)
- `plan9` - System leans in on synergy
- `minix` - simple microkernel

How? Avoid generalization of code.
- Aggressively remove edge-cases.
- Focus on core requirements specification.
- Focus on enabling simple abstractions to be combined in useful ways.

A *goal*, not always possible.

---

# *Managing* Complexity: **Abstraction**

---

## Abstraction

*Abstraction*: lets us ignore problems/complexity that aren't relevant to our task at hand.

| Goal | Abstraction üëç | Abstraction üëé |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| Persistence | FS API | SSD, Interrupts, Driver, DMA |
| UI | DOM Manipulation | Rasterization, Compositing, GPU |
| Web server | HTTP Routes & templating | network programming, string manipulations |

---

## Design to Constrain Complexity

Add *structure* to the system.

- Abstraction - Interfaces to constrain state-machines
- Modularity - Separation of concerns through encapsulation/information hiding

But how to organize the modules?
- Complexity related to inter-module dependencies

---

## Design to Constrain Complexity

Constrain $N^2$ complexity of module interconnections.

- *Layering* - Layer $i$ interacts only with $i$ and $i+1$ layers
- *Hierarchy* - Modules arranged WRT dependency relationships - interfaces separate modules

Interfaces = core of system design

---

## Interface Design

- Wide vs. Narrow
- Composition
- Separation of Concerns/Orthogonality
- Separation of mechanism and policy
- Liveness/Ownership
- Thread safety/reentrancy
- Algebraic properties: idempotency, commutativity, associativity, monotonicity, lattices
- Simplicity/Principle of least astonishment
- Principle of Least Privilege
- Non-interference

---

## System Interface and Component Design

1. resources
   - Interface-defined interactions between resources
2. namespace management
3. bindings
