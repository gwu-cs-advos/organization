## Interface Design

- How can we think about interface design?
- How can we think about designing many components with different interfaces?

---

## Generality vs. Specificity

General, thin interfaces can be polymorphic
- Multiple implementations
- Component dependencies are on *interfaces*

Techniques
- Identify resources with (hierarchical) strings
- Decouple resource resolution from access (path vs. fd)
- Operations: access/modify/delete/create resource

-v-

- The [Liskov substitution principal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle) provides the foundation for how we might think about polymorphism independent of any specific language.


---

## General Interface Examples

Virtual File System API (VFS) and/or [9P](http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/5/intro)
- OPs: open, read, write, close, creat, unlink, lseek, ...
- Polymorphic: pipe, file, socket, ...

[CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (create, read, update, delete)/REST
- OPs: GET, PUT, DELETE, POST, PATCH
- Polymorphic: cached, static webpage, dynamic webpage

---

# Abstraction Composition

---

## Function Composition

Given functions $f$ and $g$, and arguments $a$ and $a'$:
- Each function has an expected behavior
- Is that expected behavior maintained, when executed in sequence?

$f(a); g(a')$?

---

Does `strtok` compose with itself?

```c [1-3|5-9|10-17|10-25]
/* Find strings that are space-delimited*/
s1 = strtok(str, " ");
s2 = strtok(NULL, " ");

/* What about if we add another operation in-between? */
s1 = strtok(str, " ");
s3 = strtok(str2, " ");
s2 = strtok(NULL, " ");

/* How could this happen? */
void
parse(void)
{
	s1 = strtok(str, " ");
	foo();
	s2 = strtok(NULL, " ");
}

void
foo(void)
{
	/* ... */
	s3 = strtok(str2, " ");
	/* ... */
}
```

---

Contrast this with `strtok_r`

```c []
char *saved_position = NULL;
s1 = strtok_r(str, " ", &saved_position);
s3 = strtok(str2, " ");
s2 = strtok_r(NULL, " ", &saved_position);
```

---

## Composition: Locks Don't Compose

```c [1-19|22-23|26-35|37-41|43-51|53-66]
void
dec(struct account *a, int amnt)
{
	lock_take(&a->l);
	a->balance -= amnt;
	lock_release(&a->l);
}

void
inc(struct account *a, int amnt)
{
	lock_take(&a->l);
	a->balance += amnt;
	lock_release(&a->l);
}

inc(a, 10); /* correct */
/* ... */
dec(a, 10); /* correct */

/* transfer between accounts */
dec(a, 10);
inc(b, 10);
/* not necessarily correct */

void
transfer(struct account *from, *to, int amnt)
{
	lock_take(&from->l);
	lock_take(&to->l);
	to->balance += amnt;
	from->balance -= amnt;
	lock_release(&to->l);
	lock_release(&from->l);
}

/* thread 1 */
transfer(a, b, 10);
/* thread 2 */
transfer(b, a, 10);
/* potential deadlock! */

void
transfer_not_scalable(struct account *from, *to, int amnt)
{
	/* Not scalable! Single coarse-grained global lock, used everywhere */
	lock_take(&accounts->l);
	to->balance += amnt;
	from->balance -= amnt;
	lock_release(&accounts->l);
}

void
transfer_complex(struct account *from, *to, int amnt)
{
	/* lock ordering by address */
	struct account *min = MIN(from, to);
	struct account *max = MAX(from, to);

	lock_take(&min->l);
	lock_take(&max->l);
	to->balance += amnt;
	from->balance -= amnt;
	lock_release(&max->l);
	lock_release(&min->l);
}





```

-v-

Locks are not composable, and transactional memory was proposed as a solution. [Beautiful concurrency](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/beautiful.pdf) in Haskell discusses a software transactional memory approach.

---

## Composability vs. "The Right Thing"

Recursive locks have an interface that self-composes:
- Can you take a taken lock?
- `lock(&l); lock(&l); cs(); unlock(&l); unlock(&l);`

Easier to use:
- Functions can take whatever lock is relevant

Interfaces shouldn't encourage "bad behavior":
- There are [many](http://www.fieryrobot.com/blog/2008/10/14/recursive-locks-will-kill-you/) [arguments](http://www.zaval.org/resources/library/butenhof1.html) [against](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2013/04/recursive-re-entrant-locks.html) [them](https://inessential.com/2013/09/24/recursive_locks).

---

## Composition: `fork`

`fork` - create new process, copying current process' state

`fork` doesn't compose with the following...*why*?
- `pthread_create`/`pthread_mutex_lock` - thread creation and locking
- `printf` - without a `\n` in the string, nor a `fflush`
- `exec` - does the composition have strong performance?

fork exposes leaky abstractions! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Notes:
- If a thread is accessing a locked data-structure, and another thread calls `fork`, the data-structure will be left inconsistent.
- Buffered I/O suffers from the buffered output being replicated in `fork`
- `exec` must be called immediately, and all memory is replaced immediately after being copied

-v-

`fork` is [really not great](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3317550.3321435). `posix_spawn` and the like are cleaner APIs.

---

## Considerations for Composability

*Thread safety*
- Does the interface allow two threads to call functions in an interface?
- In other words: are locks and other facilities used correctly?

*Reentrancy*
- Will an implementation provide proper service if a signal triggers during its execution?
- What if the signal handler calls the component?

---

## Considerations for Composability

Reentrancy problem examples:
- What if we call `malloc` in a signal handler?
- Call buffered I/O (e.g. `printf`)?

If your interface is not thread safe and reentrant, you are *not* composable with threads nor signals.
- I'd argue to *not use signals* and "give up" on that game (there are alternatives).

Notes:
`malloc` requires locks, so if we get a signal handler while holding one of these locks, then call `malloc`, we'll take the lock a second time and, more importantly, try and access data-structures currently in a critical section.
Not good.

Similar, what if are in the middle of flushing the buffered I/O for `printf` when a signal triggers, and calls `printf` -- thus trying to flush the buffer that is already being flushed.
This will likely result in redundant output.
Note, this applies to any buffered I/O, not just to stdout.

Signal alternatives: use signals, but just have them write to a FD hooked to a pipe to send an event to the main event loop.
Or in Linux, use `signalfd`.

---

## Goal: Composability

Simple systems, complex behavior:
- Independent functions, composed to create complex behavior

UNIX commands:
- Programs with text-based input/output, composed with `|`
- `$ cat classlist | grep "gwu.edu" | wc -l` - how many students in class?

---

# Considerations for Composability

---

## Namespaces and Composability

If we have $N$ different namespaces, then interfaces speak different languages
- It is harder for functions to be composable
- They don't have the ability to consistently name resources

---

## Composability via VFS

Linux unifies interfaces around `fd`s:
- [`pidfd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pidfd_open.2.html)
- [`timerfd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timerfd_create.2.html)
- [`signalfd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/signalfd.2.html)
- [`eventfd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/eventfd.2.html)
- [`memfd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html) (vs. tmpfs)
- [`userfaultfd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html)
- [`setns`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html) to update the namespaces

Why do we want all of these that used to be different interfaces?

Notes:

- `pidfd`? How do we wait for a file to have activity and for a child process to terminate?
- Integrate all of these fds into the event loop of the application

Namespace manipulations
- Update root w/ [pivot_root](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pivot_root.2.html)
- [`clone`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html) to control what is shared upon creating a new process
- [`unshare`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html) to remove shared resources

References many resources via fds
- [`pidfd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pidfd_open.2.html) Why? How do we wait for a file to have activity and for a child process to terminate?
- [`timerfd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timerfd_create.2.html)
- [`signalfd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/signalfd.2.html)
- [`eventfd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/eventfd.2.html)
- [`memfd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html) (vs tmpfs in /tmp/) memfd’s transient use without an entry in the FS namespace means it can be better for [storing secrets](https://benjamintoll.com/2022/08/21/on-memfd_create/)
- [`userfaultfd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html)
- Even the function to set the namespace to be used [`setns`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html) does so using fds that reference namespace files in a processes’ /proc entries…

---

## Composability via VFS

Unifying the namespace of kernel resources
- ensures consistent access to all resources
- ...but often uses bit-formats (i.e. `struct`s) that are `read`/`written`.

In contrast, plan9 uses a uniform textual representation
- no `socket`, `bind`, `connect`, ... instead:
  - `echo "connect 2048" /net/tcp/2/ctl` to set who can connect to the second process' socket
  - `cat /net/tcp/2/data` to read packets

---

## Composability via Hierarchical Namespace

- `/proc/*/*` - normal programs uniformly access kernel process state
- `/sys/*` - normal programs uniformly access kernel system configuration
- [`setns`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html) updates the namespace of a process, and often requires passing a `fd` to a namespace file in the `/proc` FS.

Using hierarchical FS namespace as a *program abstraction*:
- the [`acme`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP1xVpMPn8M) editor
- the [plumber](http://9p.io/sys/doc/plumb.html) for expressive system messaging

---

## Everything is a File

In Plan 9, this is very much true.
- uniform representation of resources in the hierarchical namespace
- accessed via the small set of VFS functions
- Example: plan9 networking

# Separation of Concerns/Orthogonality

## Separation of Concerns/Orthogonality

Different *functions or components* should
- perform *non-overlapping changes* to the system, and/or
- provide *non-overlapping abstractions*.

> Do one thing well.
> - Doug McIlroy

*Why???*

-v-

- [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) (SoC)
- [Orthogonality](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch04s02.html#orthogonality)

---

## Separation of Concerns/Orthogonality

Why?

1. Redundant code
2. Complexity in interactions between implementations
3. Stratification of clients across APIs
4. *Decreased composability*

---

## Examples: Not Orthogonal

| Abstraction | Implementations |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Linux IPC | signals, pipes, System V Shared Memory, mapped files, shared files, named pipes, UNIX domain sockets, TCP/UDP sockets, DBus, Binder|
| File access | `mmap`, `read`, `readv`, `pread`, `fread`|
| Processes | `clone`, `fork`, `vfork`, `posix_spawn`|
| Event management | `poll`, `select`, `epoll`, `io_uring`, signals |

# Separation of Mechanism and Policy

---

## Separation of Mechanism and Policy

> The identification of a piece of software as "policy" or "mechanism" is a relative one. The implementor of a (virtual) resource establishes policies for the use of that resource; such policies are implemented with mechanisms provided by external software.
> Thus a hierarchy exists (under the relation "is implemented using") in which higher-level software views higher-level facilities as mechanisms.
> - Levin et al.

-v-

- [Mechanism/Policy Separation in Hydra](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800213.806531) by Levin et al.

---

## Separation of Mechanism and Policy

A perspective on dependencies

- What mechanisms is my abstraction providing to its clients?
  - often: what is the resource and its properites?
- What are the policies it wishes to enable?
  - how are resources to be used?
- Policies determine how to deploy and use the resource

---

## Separation of Mechanisms and Policy

| Mechanism | Policy |
|-----------|--------|
| UNIX Syscalls | Shell |
| Shell | Pipelines |
| X-Windows | Chrome |
| Atomic instructions | locks |
| Interrupts | Premptive Scheduling |

---

## Mech/Policy: Semantic Gap/Leaky abstractions

The *semantic gap* for an abstraction/policy can often be bypassed by instead using the mechanism of the underlying component.

*Leaky abstractions* can be avoided by a component *not* providing functionality beyond what is natural for the abstraction - instead enabling clients to talk to the underlying mechanism.

**But**...doing so often comes at the cost of composability.

---

## Contradictions

> KISS: Keep it Simple, Stupid. Don't Generalize

- "Hints and Priniciples for Computer System Design", [Lampson](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02455)

> "unnecessary specialization...is a significant contributor to software complexity"

- "Philosophy of Software Design", Ousterhout

---

## Powerful Interfaces and Components

**Composability**: Combine mechanisms $\to$ powerful policies

**Orthogonality**: Make interfaces easier to combine

**Mechanism/Policy**: Intentionally design the dependencies
