# Frequently Asked Questions

- Can undergraduates take this class?
    Yes!
    And it is on the list of tech-track courses, so it should make your curriculum path a little easier.

    I hope not, but if you do, I'm happy to grant it.
- I'm worried about how much work this will be after taking undergraduate OS.
