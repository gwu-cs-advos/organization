# Grading

## Grading Philosophy

This class very much leans into the idea that you'll get out of it what you put in.
The grading structure leans into this.

## Overall Grade

| Activity                 | % of your grade |
| ---                      | ---             |
| Code & Lecture Questions | 30%             |
| Class Participation      | 30%             |
| Homeworks + Project      | 40%             |

## Code & Lecture Questions

You'll be reading a lot of code, and watching lectures throughout the class.
Each activity will be accompanied by a form to fill out 2.25 hours before class.

Each student starts the class with an A- for this.
The grade scale for each questionaire is:

|        | not sufficient | sufficient | significant insight |
| ---    | ---            | ---        | ---                 |
| points | `0`            | `1`        | `2`                 |

At the end of the class, you're A- will be modified as such:

- Every two `0`s: grade decreases (A goes to A-, A- to B+, etc...).
	*However*, the first two `0`s count as `1`s.
- Every two `2`s: grade increases (B+ goes to A-, A- to A, etc...).
- `1`s maintain your current grade.

*Transparency.*
The goal of this grading scale is to make it obvious what your grade is at any point.

## Class Participation

Groups can form on their own, and should be around 4-6 people.
Every day, each group must select a group leader who will make sure that the group is progressing through the work.
I suggest that each group decide the group leader before the coding questions are attempted.
Everyone is expected to contribute to the group discussion.
Habitual silence will result in your grade being decreased -- otherwise, you're assumed to have an A.

*Transparency.*
I'll give you a single warning if you aren't sufficiently engaging.
After that, your participation grade will be lowered once for each time I mention it.
If I don't make it clear that you're being docked in participation, you can assume you stay at an A.
If you don't work as leader a proportional amount (for your group), your grade will be decreased.

## Class Participation if Asynchronous

If you cannot make the class (and we've discussed this), then you should form a group of those in similar situations, and do the in-lecture work together.
If you want to schedule a time with Gabe to discuss during the week, we can do so.

## Homework & Project

These will be graded by Demo.
Again, A- is the baseline for completing the assigned task.
Your grade is modified up to A if you do a great job, and show significant thought in your implementation.
It is modified downwards if you

1. don't provide sufficient testing,
2. don't consider necessary cases, or
3. don't provide necessary functionality.

*Transparency.*
You should know at the end of your demo what your grade is, and why it is what it is.

## Late Work

No late work is accepted for the Code & Lecture Questions.
On the Homeworks and Project, you lose a letter grade a day if you're late.
The *last commit* to your repo is considered your submission.

## Academic Honesty

You're allowed to work together within your group.
This can include your discussion groups in class, and your homework/project groups.
You can ask and answer general questions outside of your group on Discord and Piazza.
However, you should never see (nor provide) code nor answers from people outside your group.
