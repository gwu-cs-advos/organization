# Systems

We'll discuss and investigate a number of systems in this class.
These include:

- [Composite](https://github.com/gwsystems/composite/tree/v4) - our microkernel based on fine-grained isolation, user-level configurable policies, and component-based design.
- [libuv](https://github.com/gwu-cs-advos/libuv) - the core concurrency library underlying Node.js.
- [go](https://github.com/gwu-cs-advos/go) - a popular programming language that excels at managing complexity.
- [demikernel](https://github.com/gwu-cs-advos/demikernel) - a library-OS focused on extremely fast dataplanes in deep cloud infrastructure.
- [xv6](https://github.com/gwu-cs-advos/xv6-riscv) - a simple UNIX clone focused on pedagogy.
- [plan9](https://github.com/gwu-cs-advos/plan9) - a "UNIX done right" OS with a strong focus on "everthing is a file" and other composable abstractions.
- [busybox](https://github.com/gwu-cs-advos/busybox) - a POSIX user-level runtime that is in almost every embedded system including the bootup programs (e.g. `init`), and a set of common programs (e.g. `ls`).
- [unikraft](https://github.com/gwu-cs-advos/unikraft) - a library OS focused on providing a simple execution environment for a single application.
- [komodo](https://github.com/gwu-cs-advos/Komodo) - a minimal OS to create an enclave execution environment for an application.
- [nickel](https://github.com/gwu-cs-advos/nickel) - a security-focused OS that provides non-interference.
- [nova](https://github.com/gwu-cs-advos/NOVA) - a beautifully written microkernel focused on virtualization.
